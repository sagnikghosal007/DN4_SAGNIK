##  What is Recursion?

**Recursion** is a method where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.

In this case, each recursive call:
- Multiplies the current value by `(1 + growthRate)`
- Reduces the number of years `y` by 1
- Continues until `y == 0` (base case)
## Time and Space Complexity 
Time Complexity	: O(y)
Space Complexity:	O(y) â€“ due to recursive stack
where y=no. of years
