## ‚Ä¢ Explain React components

React components are the fundamental building blocks of a React application. A component is a reusable, self-contained unit that describes part of the user interface (UI). Components can accept input in the form of **props** and maintain their own internal **state**. They return JSX (JavaScript XML), which gets rendered on the screen.

React promotes a **component-based architecture**, allowing developers to break the UI into small, manageable pieces.

## ‚Ä¢ Identify the differences between components and JavaScript functions

| Feature                     | React Components                       | JavaScript Functions                |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Purpose                    | Used to render UI                      | Used to perform general tasks       |
| Return Type                | JSX (React elements)                   | Any value (number, object, etc.)    |
| React Integration          | Can manage props, state, lifecycle     | Not integrated with React           |
| Used In                    | React apps to build UI                 | Any JavaScript project              |
| State Handling             | Yes (using class or hooks)             | No built-in state mechanism         |
| Side Effects               | Handled using hooks (`useEffect`)      | Handled using normal JS logic       |

While function components **are JavaScript functions**, React enhances them to work with JSX, state, and effects, making them more powerful than regular functions.

## ‚Ä¢ Identify the types of components

There are **two main types** of components in React:

### 1. **Class Components**
- Based on ES6 class syntax
- Inherit from `React.Component`
- Can manage their own internal **state**
- Support **lifecycle methods**

### 2. **Function Components**
- Written using JavaScript functions
- Simpler and shorter
- Introduced with limited capabilities, but now (with **hooks**) can manage state and side effects

---

## ‚Ä¢ Explain class component

A **class component** is created using ES6 classes and must extend `React.Component`. It must define a `render()` method that returns JSX.

### Example:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Welcome extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```

### Key Features:
- Has access to **`this.props`** and **`this.state`**
- Can use **lifecycle methods** like `componentDidMount`
- Used in older or complex React projects

---

## ‚Ä¢ Explain function component

A **function component** is a simpler form of component. It takes `props` as input and returns JSX. With the introduction of **React Hooks**, function components can now handle state and side effects just like class components.

### Example:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

Or using arrow functions:

```jsx
const Welcome = ({ name }) => <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
```

### Key Features:
- Lightweight and readable
- Supports **Hooks** like `useState`, `useEffect`
- Preferred in modern React development

---

## ‚Ä¢ Define component constructor

In class components, the **constructor** is a special method used to:
- Initialize **state**
- Bind class methods to the component instance

### Example:

```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
    this.increment = this.increment.bind(this);
  }

  increment() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.increment}>Count: {this.state.count}</button>;
  }
}
```

> ‚úÖ Always call `super(props)` before accessing `this` inside the constructor.

---

## ‚Ä¢ Define render() function

The **`render()`** function is required in every class component. It describes what should be rendered to the UI. It must return a single React element (or a parent wrapper like a `<div>`).

### Example:

```jsx
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Characteristics:
- Pure: No side effects or state mutation
- Called automatically by React when `state` or `props` change
- Should only contain JSX and simple logic
